## YieldNest Core Design

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a growing sector promising transparent and independent financial empowerment worldwide. However, its complexity, including intricate cryptography, poses challenges for users. YieldNest simplifies this by offering a user-friendly, modular interface for DeFi, enhancing risk management and ensuring privacy and ownership. Our platform, available as a progressive web app, provides personalized experiences and robust security, allowing users to manage private keys securely. YieldNest's approach minimizes risks and offers a degree of self-custody beyond traditional banking, by constructing decentralized layers atop core DeFi infrastructure.
